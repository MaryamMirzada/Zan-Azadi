          Fereshteh Forough: Pioneer in Afghan Technology and Coding Education
        </h1>
        <p>
          Fereshteh Forough is an Afghan social activist and the founder of the
          non-profit organization Code to Inspire (CTI), which established the
          first coding school for girls in Afghanistan in November 2015 in
          Herat. Her mission is to empower Afghan women through digital skills
          and coding education. <br />üìñ Early Life and Education
          <br />Fereshteh Forough was born in 1985 in Iran to a family of Afghan
          refugees. After the fall of the Taliban in 2001, her family returned
          to Herat. She began her education in literature in Iran, but with her
          father‚Äôs encouragement, she developed an interest in computer science
          and obtained her bachelor‚Äôs degree from Herat University. She later
          pursued her master‚Äôs degree at the Technical University of Berlin in
          Germany. <br />üíª Code to Inspire (CTI) <br />In January 2015,
          Fereshteh Forough founded Code to Inspire (CTI). This school teaches
          coding and digital skills to girls and women aged 15 to 25 in Herat.
          She raised over $22,000 through online fundraising campaigns to
          establish the school. The main goal of CTI is to provide a safe and
          supportive environment for Afghan girls to learn technology skills.
          After the Taliban regained control in 2021, Forough continued online
          education by providing laptops and internet packages to students,
          ensuring that learning could continue remotely. <br />üèÜ Achievements
          and Recognition<br />
          In 2016, Code to Inspire received the CITRIS Athena Award for Women in
          Technology. <br />The organization also won the RISE Award from Google
          in 2016, receiving $25,000 in support.<br />
          In 2019, Fereshteh Forough was recognized as a ‚ÄúGlobal Citizen‚Äù at The
          Game Awards.

          justice. Their courage inspires generations and shows that no obstacle
          can silence a determined spirit.
